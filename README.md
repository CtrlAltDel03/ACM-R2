# ACM-R2

Through the course of the last few days, I have gone throught the very extensive and helpful set of resources. From the discord server, I have chosen two groups:
a)Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
b) Theoretical Computing - Functional Programming

I have managed to gain a broad understanding of the basics behind Machine Learning. Machine Learning has a wide area of usage and lot of applications in the present world. Machine Learning's usage of mathematics to solve complex problems has interested me to explore it's working. The same goes for Functional Programming in Theoretical Computing. The challenge of using mathematically dependent programming logic in a code excites me and I have thoroughly enjoyed it in my schooling as we were restricted to only numeric functions in Java back then. This made me choose Functional Programming over the other sub groups in Theoretical Computing.

MACHINE LEARNING : 
I have thoroughly gone through Numpy and Panda libraries. Their basic functionalities and their syntax's have been understood and implemented to a basic level to understand the flow. I beleive that these libraries are a part of the foundation required in Machine Learning. I have attached the practice questions that I have attempted for these two libraries.

I have also watched the playlist on Neural Networks covering Deep Learning by 3Blue1Brown. The playlist explains reading of hand written numbers using a neural network in Machine learning. It is a simple concept yet very unique and complex. Despite the mathematical functions being out of my knowledge, I have mamaged to comprehend its working. Given how Neural Networks builds the foundation towards more complex programs in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I felt that understanding it will help me get prepared for more in the feild.

I had started the Stanford Course CS229, however the higher level mathematics introduced in the early stages of the course made me think otherwise as I preferred full understanding of something I did rather than finishing a course just because it is highly recommended. The Harvard course CS50 seemed to start from the basic before going into the depth which looked like a lengthy process given my schedule with quizes and assignment, thus I omitted the course. This made me choose libraries that I can comprehend and practice efficiently in the given time.

THEORETICAL COMPUTING - FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING : 
I have tried the recommended Project Euler questions. Due to the large values of data in each question, lot of my programs were facing data type constrains. However, I have managed to submit quite a few and have the code for more questions that I could not get the answer for large values (they have been tested to work with comparatively small values). I have uploaded the euler codes with names 'euler<n>.c' where n is for the question number. My programs are in C language and not in Huskell as my laptop faced an issue downloading it, I will however if given a task make sure I have it ready by the time.


Despite giving priority to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the number of courses I have completed using the resources are less. However, I beleive that the through the second group I have chosen i.e., Functional Programming in Theoretical Computing, I have covered a part of Project Euler which helped me in getting accustomed to using Mathematics in coding efficiently. This prompted me to devote some time towards Project Euler towards the end of this period.
