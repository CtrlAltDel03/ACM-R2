# ACM-R2

Through the course of the last few days given to study and explore the given resources in the discord channel I have chosen mainly two groups:
a)Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
b) Theoretical Computing - Algorithm Design

I have broadly managed to understand what Machine Learning is in basic terms. Its usage and wide area of application has been observed by me. Its focus on mathematics to solve problems is what interested me. The same goes for Algorithm Design of Theoretical Computing. The challenge of using mathematically depended programming logic in a code excites me and I have thoroughly enjoyed it in my schooling as we were restricted to only numeric functions in Java back then. This made me choose Algorithm Design over other sub groups in Theoretical Computing.

I have thoroughly gone through Numpy and Panda libraries. The basic functionalities and their syntax's have been understood and implemented to a basic level to understand the flow. I have attached the practice questions I have attempted for these two libraries that by my understanding are highly useful in Machine Learning programs.
I have also watched the playlist on Neural Networks covering Deep Learning by 3Blue1Brown. The playlist explains reading of hand written numbers using a neural network in Machine learning. It is a simple concept yet very unique and complex, despite the mathematical functions being out of my knowledge, I have mamaged to comprehend the working. Given how Neural Networks builds the foundation towards more complex programs in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I felt understanding it will help me get prepared for more in the feild.

I have tried the recommended project euler questions. Due to the large values in each question, lot of my programs were facing data type constrains, however I have managed to submit quite a few and have the code for more questions that I didnt get the answer for large values (they have been tested to worl with comparatively small values). I have uploaded the euler codes with names 'euler<n>.c' where n is for the question number.

I did try starting the Stanford Course CS229
