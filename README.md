# ACM-R2

Through the course of the last few days given to study and explore the given resources in the discord channel I have chosen mainly two groups:
a)Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
b) Theoretical Computing - Algorithm

I have broadly managed to understand what Machine Learning is in basic terms. Its usage and wide area of application has been observed by me. Its focus on mathematics to solve problems is what interested me. The same goes for Algorithm Design of Theoretical Computing. The challenge of using mathematically depended programming logic in a code excites me and I have thoroughly enjoyed it in my schooling as we were restricted to only numeric functions in Java back then. This made me choose Algorithm Design over other sub groups in Theoretical Computing.

I have thoroughly gone through Numpy and Panda libraries. The basic functionalities and their syntax's have been understood and implemented to a basic level to understand the flow. I have attached the practice questions I have attempted for these two libraries that by my understanding are highly useful in Machine Learning programs.

I have tried the recommended project euler questions. Due to the large run-times of the problems perfect many answers have not been able to be submitted. However I have managed to write a program for few questions which I have attached.

Observing that the two suggested courses though very helpful did not seem feasible to me given my acads(quizes and submissions). Due to the length and basic approach of CS50 and the lengthy prerequisite list of CS229, I chose to cover libraries that help me code in ML rather than getting half baked knowledge on true ML programming.
